## Finding Type Format<a name="type-format"></a>

When GuardDuty detects suspicious or unexpected behavior in your AWS environment, it generates a finding\. A finding is a notification that contains the details about a potential security issue that GuardDuty discovers\. The finding details include information about what happened, what AWS resources were involved in the suspicious activity, when this activity took place, and other information\. 

One of the most useful pieces of information in the finding details is a **finding type**\. The purpose of the finding type is to provide a concise yet readable description of the potential security issue\. For example, the GuardDuty *Recon:EC2/PortProbeUnprotectedPort* finding type quickly informs you that somewhere in your AWS environment, an EC2 instance has an unprotected port that a potential attacker is probing\.

GuardDuty uses the following format for the various finding types that it generates:

**ThreatPurpose:ResourceTypeAffected/ThreatFamilyName\.ThreatFamilyVariant\!Artifact**

This is what each part of the format represents:

+ **ThreatPurpose** \- describes the primary purpose of a threat or a potential attack\. In the current release of GuardDuty, ThreatPurpose can have the following values:

  + **Backdoor** \- this value indicates that the attack has compromised an AWS resource and is capable of contacting its home command and control \(C&C\) server to receive further instructions for malicious activity\.

  + **Behavior** \- this value indicates that GuardDuty is detecting activity or activity patterns that are different from the established baseline for a particular AWS resource\. 

 Â + **Cryptocurrency** \- this value indicates that GuardDuty is detecting software that is associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin\.

  + **Pentest **\- Sometimes owners of AWS resources or their authorized representatives intentionally run tests against AWS applications to find vulnerabilities, like open security groups or access keys that are overly permissive\. These pen tests are done in an attempt to identify and lock down vulnerable resources before they are discovered by attackers\. However, some of the tools used by authorized pen testers are freely available, and therefore can be used by unauthorized users or attackers to run probing tests\. Although GuardDuty can't identify the true purpose behind such activity, the **Pentest** value indicates that GuardDuty is detecting such activity and that it is similar to the activity generated by known pen testing tools\. Therefore, it can be a potential attack\.

  + **Recon **\- this value indicates that a reconnaissance attack is underway, scoping out vulnerabilities in your AWS environment by probing ports, listing users, database tables, and so on\.

  + **Stealth **\- this value indicates that an attack is actively trying to hide its actions and its tracks\. For example, an attack might use an anonymizing proxy server, making it virtually impossible to gauge the true nature of the activity\.

  + **Trojan** \- this value indicates that an attack is using Trojan programs that silently carry out malicious activity\. Sometimes this software takes on an appearance of a legitimate program\. Sometimes users accidentally run this software\. Other times this software might run automatically by exploiting a vulnerability\. 

  + **UnauthorizedAccess** \- this value indicates that GuardDuty is detecting suspicious activity or a suspicious activity pattern by an unauthorized individual\.

+ **ResourceTypeAffected** \- describes which AWS resource is identified in this finding as the potential target of an attack\. In this release of GuardDuty, only EC2 instances and IAM users \(and their credentials\) can be identified as affected resources in GuardDuty findings\. 

+ **ThreatFamilyName** \- describes the overall threat or potential malicious activity that GuardDuty is detecting\. For example, a value of **NetworkPortUnusual** indicates that an EC2 instance identified in the GuardDuty finding has no prior history of communications on a particular remote port that also is identified in the finding\.

+ **ThreatFamilyVariant** \- describes the specific variant of the **ThreatFamily** that GuardDuty is detecting\. Attackers often slightly modify the functionality of the attack, thus creating new variants\.

+ **Artifact** \- describes a specific resource that is owned by a tool that is used in the attack\. For example, **DNS** in the finding type *CryptoCurrency:EC2/BitcoinTool\.B\!DNS* indicates that an EC2 instance is communicating with a known Bitcoin\-related domain\.

### Backdoor:EC2/XORDDOS<a name="backdoor2"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="backdoor2_description"></a>

**An EC2 instance is attempting to communicate with an IP address that is associated with XorDDos malware\.**

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is attempting to communicate with an IP address that is associated with XorDDos malware\. This EC2 instance might be compromised\. XOR DDoS is Trojan malware that hijacks Linux systems\. To gain access to the system, it launches a brute force attack in order to discover the password to Secure Shell \(SSH\) services on Linux\. After SSH credentials are acquired and the login is successful, it uses root privileges to run a script that downloads and installs XOR DDoS\. This malware is then used as part of a botnet to launch distributed denial of service \(DDoS\) attacks against other targets\. For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

### Backdoor:EC2/Spambot<a name="backdoor6"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="backdoor6_description"></a>

**EC2 instance is exhibiting unusual behavior by communicating with a remote host on port 25\. **

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is communicating with a remote host on port 25\. This behavior is unusual because this EC2 instance has no prior history of communications on port 25\. Port 25 is traditionally used by mail servers for SMTP communications\. Your EC2 instance might be compromised and sending out spam\. For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\. 

### Backdoor:EC2/C&CActivity\.B\!DNS<a name="backdoor7"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="backdoor7_description"></a>

**EC2 instance is querying a domain name that is hosted by a known command and control server\.**

This finding informs you that there is an EC2 instance in your AWS environment that is querying a domain name associated with a known command and control \(C&C\) server\. Your EC2 instance might be compromised\. C&C servers are computers that issue commands to members of a botnet\. A botnet is a collection of internet\-connected devices \(which might include PCs, servers, mobile devices, and internet of things devices\) that are infected and controlled by a common type of malware\. Botnets are often used to distribute malware and gather misappropriated information, such as credit card numbers\. Depending on the purpose and structure of the botnet, the C&C server might also issue commands to begin a distributed denial of service \(DDoS\) attack\. For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

### Behavior:IAMUser/InstanceLaunchUnusual<a name="behavior1"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="behavior1_description"></a>

**An IAM user launched an EC2 instance of an unusual type\.**

This finding informs you that a specific IAM user in your AWS environment is exhibiting behavior that is different from the established baseline\. This IAM user has no prior history of launching an EC2 instance of this type\. Your IAM user credentials might be compromised\. For more information, see [Remediating Compromised AWS Credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)

### Behavior:EC2/NetworkPortUnusual<a name="behavior3"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="behavior3_description"></a>

**EC2 instance is generating unusually large amounts of network traffic to a remote host\.**

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is behaving in a way that deviates from the established baseline\. This EC2 instance has no prior history of sending this much traffic to this remote host\. Your EC2 instance might be compromised\. For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

### CryptoCurrency:EC2/BitcoinTool\.B\!DNS<a name="crypto3"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="crypto3_description"></a>

**EC2 instance is querying a domain name that is associated with Bitcoin\-related activity\.**

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is querying a domain name that is associated with Bitcoin\-related activity\. Bitcoin is a worldwide cryptocurrency and digital payment system\. Besides being created as a reward for Bitcoin mining, bitcoin can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services\. Unless you use this EC2 instance to mine or manage cryptocurrency, your EC2 instance might be compromised\. For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

### PenTest:IAMUser/KaliLinux<a name="pentest1"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="pentest1_description"></a>

**An API was invoked from a Kali Linux EC2 instance\.**

This finding informs you that a machine running Kali Linux is making API calls using credentials that belong to your AWS account\. Your credentials might be compromised\. Kali Linux is a popular penetration testing tool used by security professionals to identify weaknesses in EC2 instances that require patching\. This tool is also used by attackers to find EC2 configuration weaknesses and gain unauthorized access to your AWS environment\. For more information, see [Remediating Compromised AWS Credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)\.

### Recon:EC2/PortProbeUnprotectedPort<a name="recon6"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="recon6_description"></a>

**EC2 instance has an unprotected port that is being probed by a known malicious host\. **

This finding informs you that a port on an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is not blocked by a security group, access control list \(ACL\), or an on\-host firewall \(for example, Linux IPChains\), and known scanners on the internet are actively probing it\. If the identified unprotected port is 22 or 3389 and you often connect to this EC2 instance by using SSH/RDP and therefore can't block access to either of these ports, you can still limit exposure by allowing access to these ports only to the IP addresses from your corporate network IP address space\. To restrict access to port 22 on Linux, see [http://docs\.aws\.amazon\.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing\-access\-to\-an\-instance\.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html)\. To restrict access to port 3389 on Windows, see [http://docs\.aws\.amazon\.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/authorizing\-access\-to\-an\-instance\.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html)\.

For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

### Recon:IAMUser/TorIPCaller<a name="recon1"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="recon1_description"></a>

**An API was invoked from a Tor exit node IP address\. **

This finding informs you that an API operation that can list or describe your AWS resources was invoked from a Tor exit node IP address\. Tor is software for enabling anonymous communication\. It encrypts and randomly bounces communications through relays between a series of network nodes\. The last Tor node is called the exit node\. This can be a reconnaissance attack: an anonymous user trying to gather information or gain access to your AWS resources for malicious purposes\. For more information, see [Remediating Compromised AWS Credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)\. 

### Recon:IAMUser/MaliciousIPCaller\.Custom<a name="recon2"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="recon2_description"></a>

**An API was invoked from an IP address on a custom threat list\.**

This finding informs you that an API operation that can list or describe your AWS resources was invoked from an IP address that is included on a threat list that you uploaded\. In GuardDuty, a threat list consists of known malicious IP addresses\. GuardDuty generates findings based on uploaded threat lists\. This can be a reconnaissance attack: an anonymous user trying to gather information or gain access to your AWS resources for malicious purposes\. For more information, see [Remediating Compromised AWS Credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)\. 

### Recon:IAMUser/MaliciousIPCaller<a name="recon3"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="recon3_description"></a>

**An API was invoked from a known malicious IP address\.**

This finding informs you that an API operation that can list or describe your AWS resources was invoked from an IP address that is included on a threat list\. In GuardDuty, a threat list consists of known malicious IP addresses\. GuardDuty generates findings based on the custom or internal threat lists\. This can be a reconnaissance attack: an anonymous user trying to gather information or gain access to your AWS resources for malicious purposes\. For more information, see [Remediating Compromised AWS Credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)\.

### Recon:EC2/Portscan<a name="recon5"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="recon5_description"></a>

**EC2 instance is performing outbound port scans to a remote host\.**

This finding informs you that there is an EC2 instance in your AWS environment that is engaged in a possible port scan attack because it is trying to connect to multiple ports over a short period of time\. The purpose of a port scan attack is to locate open ports to discover what services the machine is running and to identify its operating system\. Your EC2 instance might be compromised\. For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

### Stealth:IAMUser/PasswordPolicyChange<a name="stealth1"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="stealth1_description"></a>

**Account password policy was weakened\.**

Your AWS account password policy was weakened\. For example, it was deleted or updated to require fewer characters, not require symbols and numbers, or required to extend the password expiration period\. This finding can also be triggered by an attempt to update or delete your AWS account password policy from an unusual location, time of day, or by an unusual user\. The AWS account password policy defines the rules that govern what kinds of passwords can be set for your IAM users\. A weaker password policy permits the creation of passwords that are easy to remember and potentially easier to guess, thereby creating a security risk\. For more information, see [Remediating Compromised AWS Credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)\. 

### Stealth:IAMUser/CloudTrailLoggingDisabled<a name="stealth2"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="stealth2_description"></a>

**AWS CloudTrail trail was disabled\.**

This finding informs you that a CloudTrail trail within your AWS environment was disabled\. This can be an attacker's attempt to disable logging to cover their tracks by eliminating any trace of their activity while gaining access to your AWS resources for malicious purposes\. This finding can be triggered by a successful deletion or update of a trail from an unusual location, time of day, or by an unusual user\. This finding can also be triggered by a successful deletion of an S3 bucket that stores the logs from a trail that is associated with GuardDuty\. For more information, see [Remediating Compromised AWS Credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)\.

It encrypts and randomly bounces communications through relays between a series of network nodes\. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources with the intent of hiding the attackerâs true identity\. For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

### UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/MaliciousIPCaller\.Custom<a name="unauthorized8"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="unauthorized8_description"></a>

**EC2 instance is communicating outbound with a IP address on a custom threat list\.**

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is communicating outbound using the TCP protocol with an IP address included on a threat list that you uploaded\. In GuardDuty, a threat list consists of known malicious IP addresses\. GuardDuty generates findings based on uploaded threat lists\. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources\. For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

### UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce<a name="unauthorized9"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="unauthorized9_description"></a>

**EC2 instance has been involved in SSH brute force attacks\.**

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment was involved in a brute force attack aimed at obtaining passwords to SSH services on Linux\-based systems\. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources\. For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

### UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/RDPBruteForce<a name="unauthorized10"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="unauthorized10_description"></a>

**EC2 instance has been involved in RDP brute force attacks\.**

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment was involved in a brute force attack aimed at obtaining passwords to RDP services on Windows\-based systems\. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources\. For more information, see [Remediating a Compromised EC2 Instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

### UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration<a name="unauthorized11"></a>

#### Finding description<a name="unauthorized11_description"></a>

**Credentials that were created exclusively for an EC2 instance through an instance launch role are being used from an external IP address\.**

This finding informs you of attempts to run AWS API operations from a host outside of EC2, using temporary AWS credentials that were created on an EC2 instance in your AWS account\. Your EC2 instance might be compromised, and the temporary credentials from this instance might have been exfiltrated to a remote host outside of AWS\. AWS does not recommend redistributing temporary credentials outside of the entity that created them \(for example, AWS applications, EC2, or Lambda\)\. However, authorized users can export credentials from their EC2 instances to make legitimate API calls\. To rule out a potential attack and verify the legitimacy of the activity, contact the IAM user to whom these credentials are assigned\. For more information, see [Remediating Compromised AWS Credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)\. 

This finding is commonly triggered in AWS Direct Connect scenarios where all traffic from EC2 instances is routed into your on\-premises network and out your own firewall, thus appearing to originate from an IP address that is external to EC2\. If it's common practice in your AWS production environment to exfiltrate temporary AWS credentials created on EC2 instances, you can whitelist this finding by adding the IP address listed in the **service\.action\.awsApiCallAction\.remoteIpDetails\.ipAddressV4** field in the finding's JSON to your active trusted IP list\. \(You can view the finding's complete JSON, by selecting the finding in the console, and then choosing **Actions/Export**, or by running the [GetFindings](get-findings.md) API operation\)\. A GuardDuty trusted IP list consists of IP addresses that you have whitelisted for secure communication with your AWS infrastructure and applications\. GuardDuty does not generate findings for IP addresses on trusted IP lists\. For more information, see [Uploading Trusted IP Lists and Threat Lists](guardduty_upload_lists.md)
