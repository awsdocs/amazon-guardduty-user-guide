#### <a name="persistence-iam-networkpermissions_full"></a>

This finding indicates that a specific principal \(AWS account root user, IAM role, or IAM user\) in your AWS environment is exhibiting behavior that is different from the established baseline\. This principal has no prior history of invoking this API\.

This finding is triggered when network configuration settings are changed under suspicious circumstances, such as when a principal invokes the `CreateSecurityGroup` API with no prior history of doing so\. Attackers often attempt to change security groups to allow certain inbound traffic on various ports to improve their ability to access an EC2 instance\.

#### <a name="persistence-iam-networkpermissions_remediation"></a>

**Remediation recommendations:**

If this activity is unexpected your credentials may be compromised, see [Remediating compromised AWS credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)\.

## Persistence:IAMUser/ResourcePermissions<a name="persistence-iam-resourcepermissions"></a>

### A principal invoked an API commonly used to change the security access policies of various resources in your AWS account\.<a name="persistence-iam-resourcepermissions_description"></a>

#### <a name="persistence-iam-resourcepermissions_severity"></a>

**Default severity: Medium\***

**Note**  
This finding's default severity is Medium\. However, if the API is invoked is using temporary AWS credentials that are created on an instance, the finding's severity is High\.

#### <a name="persistence-iam-resourcepermissions_full"></a>

This finding indicates that a specific principal \(AWS account root user, IAM role, or IAM user\) in your AWS environment is exhibiting behavior that is different from the established baseline\. This principal has no prior history of invoking this API\. 

This finding is triggered when a change is detected to policies or permissions attached to AWS resources, such as when a principal in your AWS environment invokes the `PutBucketPolicy` API with no prior history of doing so\. Some services, such as Amazon S3, support resource\-attached permissions that grant one or more principals access to the resource\. With stolen credentials, attackers can change the policies attached to a resource in order to gain access to that resource\.

### A principal invoked an API commonly used to add, modify, or delete IAM users, groups or policies in your AWS account\.<a name="persistence-iam-userpermissions_description"></a>

#### <a name="persistence-iam-userpermissions_severity"></a>

**Default severity: Medium\***

**Note**  
This finding's default severity is Medium\. However, if the API is invoked using temporary AWS credentials that are created on an instance, the finding's severity is High\.

#### <a name="persistence-iam-userpermissions_full"></a>

This finding indicates that a specific principal \(AWS account root user, IAM role, or IAM user\) in your AWS environment is exhibiting behavior that is different from the established baseline\. This principal has no prior history of invoking this API\. 

This finding is triggered by suspicious changes to the user\-related permissions in your AWS environment, such as when a principal in your AWS environment invokes the `AttachUserPolicy` API with no prior history of doing so\. Attackers may use stolen credentials to create new users, add access policies to existing users, or create access keys to maximize their access to an account, even if their original access point is closed\. For example, the owner of the account might notice that a particular IAM user or password was stolen and delete it from the account\. However, they might not delete other users that were created by a fraudulently created admin principal, leaving their AWS account accessible to the attacker\. 

#### <a name="persistence-iam-userpermissions_remediation"></a>

**Remediation recommendations:**

If this activity is unexpected your credentials may be compromised, see [Remediating compromised AWS credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)\.

## Policy:IAMUser/RootCredentialUsage<a name="policy-iam-rootcredentialusage"></a>

### An API was invoked using root credentials\.<a name="policy-iam-rootcredentialusage_description"></a>

#### <a name="policy-iam-rootcredentialusage_severity"></a>

**Default severity: Low**

#### <a name="policy-iam-rootcredentialusage_full"></a>

This finding informs you that the root credentials of the listed AWS account in your environment are being used to make requests to AWS services\. It is recommended that users never use root credentials to access AWS services\. Instead, AWS services should be accessed using least privilege temporary credentials from AWS Security Token Service \(STS\)\.

## PrivilegeEscalation:IAMUser/AdministrativePermissions<a name="privilegeescalation-iam-administrativepermissions"></a>

### A principal has attempted to assign a highly permissive policy to themselves\.<a name="privilegeescalation-iam-administrativepermissions_description"></a>

#### <a name="privilegeescalation-iam-administrativepermissions_severity"></a>

**Default severity: Low\***

**Note**  
This finding's severity is Low if the attempt at privilege escalation was unsuccessful, and Medium if the attempt at privilege escalation was successful\.

#### <a name="privilegeescalation-iam-administrativepermissions_full"></a>

This finding indicates that a specific IAM entity in your AWS environment is exhibiting behavior that can be indicative of a privilege escalation attack\. This finding is triggered when an IAM user or role attempts to assign a highly permissive policy to themselves\. If the user or role in question is not meant to have administrative privileges, either the user's credentials may be compromised or the role's permissions may not be configured properly\. 

Attackers will use stolen credentials to create new users, add access policies to existing users, or create access keys to maximize their access to an account even if their original access point is closed\. For example, the owner of the account might notice that a particular IAM user or password was stolen and delete it from the account, but might not delete other users that were created by a fraudulently created admin principal, leaving their AWS account still accessible to the attacker\.

#### <a name="unauthorizedaccess-iam-consoleloginsuccessb_severity"></a>

**Default severity: Medium**

#### <a name="unauthorizedaccess-iam-consoleloginsuccessb_full"></a>

This finding informs you that multiple successful console logins for the same IAM user were observed around the same time in various geographical locations\. Such anomalous and risky access location patterns indicate potential unauthorized access to your AWS resources\. 

#### <a name="unauthorizedaccess-iam-consoleloginsuccessb_remediation"></a>

**Remediation recommendations:**

If this activity is unexpected your credentials may be compromised, see [Remediating compromised AWS credentials](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-creds)\.

## UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration<a name="unauthorizedaccess-iam-instancecredentialexfiltration"></a>

### Credentials that were created exclusively for an EC2 instance through an Instance launch role are being used from an external IP address\.<a name="unauthorizedaccess-iam-instancecredentialexfiltration_description"></a>

#### <a name="unauthorizedaccess-iam-instancecredentialexfiltration_severity"></a>

**Default severity: High**

#### <a name="unauthorizedaccess-iam-instancecredentialexfiltration_full"></a>

This finding informs you of attempts to run AWS API operations from a host outside of EC2, using temporary AWS credentials that were created on an EC2 instance in your AWS environment\. The listed EC2 instance might be compromised, and the temporary credentials from this instance might have been exfiltrated to a remote host outside of AWS\. AWS does not recommend redistributing temporary credentials outside of the entity that created them \(for example, AWS applications, EC2, or Lambda\)\. However, authorized users can export credentials from their EC2 instances to make legitimate API calls\. To rule out a potential attack and verify the legitimacy of the activity, contact the IAM user to whom these credentials are assigned\.

**Note**  
If S3 threat detection is enabled for the account this finding may be generated in response to attempts to run S3 data plane operations on the S3 resources using EC2 credentials\. The API call used will be listed in the finding details\. If S3 threat detection is not enabled this finding can only be triggered by Event log API's\. For more information on S3 threat detection see [Amazon S3 protection in Amazon GuardDuty](s3_detection.md)\.

#### <a name="unauthorizedaccess-iam-instancecredentialexfiltration_remediation"></a>

**Remediation recommendations:**

This finding is generated when networking is configured to route internet traffic such that it egresses from an on\-premises gateway rather than from a VPC Internet Gateway \(IGW\)\. Common configurations, such as using , [AWS Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/), or VPC VPN connections, can result in traffic routed this way\. If this is expected behavior, it's recommended that you use suppression rules in and create a rule that consists of two filter criteria\. The first criteria is **finding type**, which should be `UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration`\. The second filter criteria is **API caller IPv4 Address** with the IP address or CIDR range of your on\-premises internet gateway\. To learn more about creating suppression rules see [Suppression rules](findings_suppression-rule.md)\.

This finding informs you that an API operation \(for example, an attempt to launch an EC2 instance, create a new IAM user, or modify your AWS privileges\) was invoked from a Tor exit node IP address\. Tor is software for enabling anonymous communication\. It encrypts and randomly bounces communications through relays between a series of network nodes\. The last Tor node is called the exit node\. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources with the intent of hiding the attacker's true identity\.
