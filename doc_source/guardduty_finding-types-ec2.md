# GuardDuty EC2 finding types<a name="guardduty_finding-types-ec2"></a>

The following findings are specific to Amazon EC2 resources and always have a Resource Type of `Instance`\. The severity and details of the findings differ based on the Resource Role, which indicates whether the EC2 instance was the target of suspicious activity or the actor performing the activity\.

**Note**  
Instance details may be missing for some EC2 findings if the instance has already been terminated or if the underlying API call was part of a cross Region API call that originated from an EC2 instance in a different Region\.

For all instance type findings, it is recommended that you examine the resource in question to determine if it is behaving in an expected manner\. If the activity is authorized, you can use Suppression Rules or Trusted IP lists to prevent false positive notifications for that resource\. If the activity is unexpected, the security best practice is to assume the instance has been compromised and take the actions detailed in [Remediating a compromised EC2 instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

#### <a name="impact-ec2-abuseddomainrequestreputation_severity"></a>

**Default severity: Medium**

#### <a name="impact-ec2-abuseddomainrequestreputation_full"></a>

This finding informs you that the listed Amazon EC2 instance within your AWS environment is querying a low reputation domain name associated with known abused domains or IP addresses\. Examples of abused domains are top level domain names \(TLDs\) and second\-level domain names \(2LDs\) providing free subdomain registrations as well as dynamic DNS providers\. Threat actors tend to use these services to register domains for free or at low costs\. Low reputation domains in this category may also be expired domains resolving to a registrar's parking IP address and therefore may no longer be active\. A parking IP is where a registrar directs traffic for domains that have not been linked to any service\. The listed Amazon EC2 instance may be compromised as threat actors commonly use these registrar's or services for C&C and malware distribution\.

Low reputation domains are based on a reputation score model developed by GuardDuty, which evaluates and ranks the characteristics of a domain to determine its likelihood of being malicious\.

#### <a name="recon-ec2-portprobeemrunprotectedport_severity"></a>

**Default severity: High**

#### <a name="recon-ec2-portprobeemrunprotectedport_full"></a>

This finding informs you that an EMR related sensitive port on the listed EC2 instance that is part of an cluster in your AWS environment is not blocked by a security group, an access control list \(ACL\), or an on\-host firewall such as Linux IPTables, and that known scanners on the internet are actively probing it\. Ports that can trigger this finding, such as port 8088 \(YARN Web UI port\), could potentially be used for remote code execution\. 

#### <a name="recon-ec2-portprobeemrunprotectedport_remediation"></a>

**Remediation recommendations:**

You should block open access to ports on clusters from the internet and restrict access only to specific IP addresses that require access to these ports\. For more information see, [Security Groups for EMR Clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-security-groups.html)\.

## Recon:EC2/PortProbeUnprotectedPort<a name="recon-ec2-portprobeunprotectedport"></a>

#### <a name="recon-ec2-portprobeunprotectedport_severity"></a>

**Default severity: Low\***

**Note**  
This finding's default severity is Low\. However, if the port being probed is used by \(9200 or 9300\), the finding's severity is High\.

#### <a name="recon-ec2-portprobeunprotectedport_full"></a>

This finding informs you that a port on the listed EC2 instance in your AWS environment is not blocked by a security group, access control list \(ACL\), or an on\-host firewall such as Linux IPTables, and that known scanners on the internet are actively probing it\. 

 If the identified unprotected port is 22 or 3389 and you are using these ports to connect to your instance, you can still limit exposure by allowing access to these ports only to the IP addresses from your corporate network IP address space\. To restrict access to port 22 on Linux, see [Authorizing Inbound Traffic for Your Linux Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html)\. To restrict access to port 3389 on Windows, see [Authorizing Inbound Traffic for Your Windows Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html)\.

#### <a name="recon-ec2-portprobeunprotectedport_remediation"></a>

**Remediation recommendations:**

There may be cases in which instances are intentionally exposed, for example if they are hosting web servers\. If this is the case in your AWS environment, we recommend that you set up a suppression rule for this finding\. The suppression rule should consist of two filter criteria\. The first criteria should use the **Finding type** attribute with a value of `Recon:EC2/PortProbeUnprotectedPort`\. The second filter criteria should match the instance or instances that serve as a bastion host\. You can use either the **Instance image ID** attribute or the **Tag** value attribute, depending on which criteria is identifiable with the instances that host these tools\. For more information about creating suppression rules see [Suppression rules](findings_suppression-rule.md)\.

If this activity is unexpected, your instance is likely compromised, see [Remediating a compromised EC2 instance](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-ec2)\.

#### <a name="recon-ec2-portscan_full"></a>

This finding informs you that the listed EC2 instance in your AWS environment is engaged in a possible port scan attack because it is trying to connect to multiple ports over a short period of time\. The purpose of a port scan attack is to locate open ports to discover which services the machine is running and to identify its operating system\.

#### <a name="recon-ec2-portscan_remediation"></a>

**Remediation recommendations:**

This finding can be a false positive when vulnerability assessment applications are deployed on EC2 instances in your environment because these applications conduct portscans to alert you about misconfigured open ports\. If this is the case in your AWS environment, we recommend that you set up a suppression rule for this finding\. The suppression rule should consist of two filter criteria\. The first criteria should use the **Finding type** attribute with a value of `Recon:EC2/Portscan`\. The second filter criteria should match the instance or instances that host these vulnerability assessment tools\. You can use either the **Instance image ID** attribute or the **Tag** value attribute depending on which criteria are identifiable with the instances that host these tools\. For more information about creating suppression rules see [Suppression rules](findings_suppression-rule.md)\.

## UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/MetadataDNSRebind<a name="unauthorizedaccess-ec2-metadatadnsrebind"></a>

### An EC2 instance is performing DNS lookups that resolve to the instance metadata service\.<a name="unauthorizedaccess-ec2-metadatadnsrebind_description"></a>

#### <a name="unauthorizedaccess-ec2-metadatadnsrebind_severity"></a>

**Default severity: High**

#### <a name="unauthorizedaccess-ec2-metadatadnsrebind_full"></a>

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is querying a domain that resolves to the EC2 metadata IP address \(169\.254\.169\.254\)\. A DNS query of this kind may indicate that the instance is a target of a DNS rebinding technique\. This technique can be used to obtain metadata from an EC2 instance, including the IAM credentials associated with the instance\.

DNS rebinding involves tricking an application running on the EC2 instance to load return data from a URL, where the domain name in the URL resolves to the EC2 metadata IP address \(169\.254\.169\.254\)\. This causes the application to access EC2 metadata and possibly make it available to the attacker\. 

It is possible to access EC2 metadata using DNS rebinding only if the EC2 instance is running a vulnerable application that allows injection of URLs, or if someone accesses the URL in a web browser running on the EC2 instance\.

#### <a name="unauthorizedaccess-ec2-metadatadnsrebind_remediation"></a>

**Remediation recommendations:**

In response to this finding, you should evaluate if there is a vulnerable application running on the EC2 instance, or if someone used a browser to access the domain identified in the finding\. If the root cause is a vulnerable application, you should fix the vulnerability\. If someone browsed the identified domain, you should block the domain or prevent users from accessing it\. If you determine this finding was related to either case above, you should [revoke the session associated with the EC2 instance](id_roles_use_revoke-sessions.html)\.

Some AWS customers intentionally map the metadata IP address to a domain name on their authoritative DNS servers\. If this is the case in your environment, we recommend that you set up a suppression rule for this finding\. The suppression rule should consist of two filter criteria\. The first criteria should use the **Finding type** attribute with a value of `UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/MetaDataDNSRebind`\. The second filter criteria should be **DNS request domain** and the value should match the domain you have mapped to the metadata IP address \(169\.254\.169\.254\)\. For more information on creating suppression rules see [Suppression rules](findings_suppression-rule.md)\.

## UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/RDPBruteForce<a name="unauthorizedaccess-ec2-rdpbruteforce"></a>
