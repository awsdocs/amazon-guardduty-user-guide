# GuardDuty S3 finding types<a name="guardduty_finding-types-s3"></a>

The following findings are specific to S3 bucket resources and will always have a Resource Type of `S3Bucket`\. The severity and details of the findings will differ based on the finding type and the permission associated with the bucket\.

For all S3 Bucket type findings it is recommended that you examine the permissions on the bucket in question and the permissions of any users involved in the finding, if the activity is unexpected see the remediation recommendations detailed in [Remediating a Compromised S3 Bucket](guardduty_remediate.md#compromised-s3)\.

## Discovery:S3/BucketEnumeration\.Unusual<a name="discovery-s3-bucketenumerationunusual"></a>

### An IAM entity invoked an S3 API used to discover S3 buckets within your network\.<a name="discovery-s3-bucketenumerationunusual_description"></a>

#### <a name="discovery-s3-bucketenumerationunusual_severity"></a>

**Default severity: Medium**

This finding informs you that an IAM entity has invoked an S3 API to discover S3 buckets in your environment, such as `ListBuckets`\. This type of activity is associated with the discovery stage of an attack wherein an attacker is gathering information to determine if your AWS environment is susceptible to a broader attack\. This activity is suspicious because the way the IAM entity invoked the API was unusual\. For example, this IAM entity had no prior history of invoking this type of API, or the API was invoked from an unusual location\.

## Policy:S3/AccountBlockPublicAccessDisabled<a name="policy-s3-accountblockpublicaccessdisabled"></a>

### An IAM entity invoked an API used to disable S3 block public access on an account\.<a name="policy-s3-accountblockpublicaccessdisabled_description"></a>

#### <a name="policy-s3-accountblockpublicaccessdisabled_severity"></a>

**Default severity: Low**

This finding informs you that Amazon S3 Block Public Access was disabled at the account level\. When S3 Block Public Access settings are enabled, they are used to filter the policies or access control lists \(ACLs\) on buckets as a security measure to prevent inadvertent public exposure of data\. 

Typically, S3 Block Public Access is turned off in an account to allow public access to a bucket or to the objects in the bucket\. When S3 Block Public Access is disabled for an account, access to your buckets is controlled by the policies, ACLs, or bucket\-level Block Public Access settings applied to your individual buckets\. This does not necessarily mean that the buckets are shared publicly, but that you should audit the permissions applied to the buckets to confirm that they provide the appropriate level of access\.

## Policy:S3/BucketBlockPublicAccessDisabled<a name="policy-s3-bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled"></a>

### An IAM entity invoked an API used to disable S3 block public access on a bucket\.<a name="policy-s3-bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled_description"></a>

#### <a name="policy-s3-bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled_severity"></a>

**Default severity: Low**

This finding informs you that Amazon S3 Block Public Access was disabled for the listed S3 bucket\. When enabled, S3 Block Public Access settings are used to filter the policies or access control lists \(ACLs\) applied to buckets as a security measure to prevent inadvertent public exposure of data\. 

Typically, S3 Block Public Access is turned off on a bucket to allow public access to the bucket or to the objects within\. When S3 Block Public Access is disabled for a bucket, access to the bucket is controlled by the policies or ACLs applied to it\. This does not mean that the bucket is shared publicly, but you should audit the policies and ACLs applied to the bucket to confirm that appropriate permissions are applied\.

## Policy:S3/BucketAnonymousAccessGranted<a name="policy-s3-bucketanonymousaccessgranted"></a>

### An IAM principal has granted access to an S3 bucket to the internet by changing bucket policies or ACLs\.<a name="policy-s3-bucketanonymousaccessgranted_description"></a>

#### <a name="policy-s3-bucketanonymousaccessgranted_severity"></a>

**Default severity: High**

This finding informs you that the listed S3 bucket has been made publicly accessible on the internet because an IAM entity has changed a bucket policy or ACL on that bucket\. After a policy or ACL change is detected, GuardDuty uses automated reasoning powered by [Zelkova](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/protect-sensitive-data-in-the-cloud-with-automated-reasoning-zelkova/), to determine if the bucket is publicly accessible\.

**Note**  
If a bucket's ACLs or bucket policies are configured to explicitly deny GuardDuty or to deny all, this finding cannot be generated for that bucket\.
